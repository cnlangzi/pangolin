//! `/logs` page route — admin UI for the live access log viewer.
//!
//! Issue #73. The page itself is a static HTML shell that opens
//! an `EventSource` to `/api/logs/stream`; the page handler does
//! not need to talk to the broadcast channel itself. The route
//! returns the same skeleton as the other list pages (sites,
//! domains, certs) so the existing `base.html` layout applies.
//!
//! CSRF / auth: inherited from the parent `admin::handle()` — the
//! page is only reachable by an authenticated admin, and the
//! EventSource sends the session cookie on its own GET so no
//! additional CSRF is required (browsers can't send a custom
//! `X-CSRF-Token` header from `EventSource` anyway).
//!
//! Asset / CSRF substitution is applied by the parent handler via
//! `render_with_assets_and_csrf`, so we just produce a vanilla
//! HTML body here.
